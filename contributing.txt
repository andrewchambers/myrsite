Contact Info
------------

The Myrddin hackers hang out in #project79068 on irc.eigenstate.org. Most
design discussion happens there. 

We also have the [myrddin-dev](http://eigenstate.org/mail-lists)
mailing list on eigenstate.org, which is largely used for announcements
and design summaries.

Submitting Code
---------------

The canonical code repository is on
[https://git.eigenstate.org](https://git.eigenstate.org), but is
mirrored on github. We will accept patches on the mailing lists,
github pull requests, or snail mail (Please inquire in IRC for the
address).

Updating the site
----------------

This [website](http://git.eigenstate.org/ori/myrsite.git) is maintained using
markdown, and is stored in git. We accept pull requests for it, and treat it
like a wiki.

	git clone git://git.eigenstate.org/git//ori/myrsite.git

Should you wish to generate the HTML locally, the site is generated using
[USSM](http://loup-vaillant.fr/projects/ussm/), and compiled with a mildly
customized Markdown compiler, which knows how to generate runnable code
snippets. This markdown compiler is available
[here](https://git.eigenstate.org/ori/sundown-myr.git).
