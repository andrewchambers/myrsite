Getting a copy
--------------

Myrddin runs on amd64 versions of Linux, OSX, FreeBSD, and 9front, with more
ports warmly welcomed.

The easiest way to get an up to date copy of Myrddin is to install it from git.
The language is still changing rapidly, and releases simply haven't made much
sense to date (although it's actually getting there!)

To start off, download the dependencies. If you're on a Debian derivative,
this should be sufficient:

	sudo apt-get install bison gcc git make
	
Then, get the compiler:

	git clone git://git.eigenstate.org/git/ori/mc.git

Building and installing it matches the traditional ./configure; make; make install
dance:

	cd mc               # the directory you cloned into

You then run `./configure`, as usual. I generally configure with
`--prefix=$HOME/bin`, instead of the default `/usr/local`. If you chose a
nonstandard prefix, make sure that `$prefix/bin` is in `$PATH`, or the binaries
will not be found when you try to run commands.

	./configure	    # probe the OS
	make                # build it

At this point, it would be good to make sure that the build you have works:

	make check

This should succeed. Assuming that's the case, you can install.

	make install

Optional: Editor Support
--------------

Shipped with Myrddin, but not installed by default, is autoindent and syntax
highlighting support for Myrddin for vim. To set this up, copy the files
into your `~/.vim` directory. From within the git checkout:

	mkdir ~/.vim	# if it doesn't already exist
	cp -r support/vim/* ~/.vim

If you happen to like Howl, Ryan Gonzalez has contributed support for it,
and it's available here: [https://github.com/kirbyfan64/howl-myr](
https://github.com/kirbyfan64/howl-myr). To install, follow the directions
listed:

	mkdir -p ~/.howl/bundles
	cd ~/.howl/bundles
	git clone https://github.com/kirbyfan64/howl-myr.git

Optional: Ctags Support
--------------

There's also a patched version of exuberant-ctags which can be used for
indexing Myrddin code, available here: [https://github.com/oridb/ctags-myr.git](
https://github.com/oridb/ctags-myr.git). This code can be built and installed
with the following sequence of commands:

	sudo apt-get build-dep exuberant-ctags
	git clone https://github.com/oridb/ctags-myr.git
	cd ctags-myr/
	aclocal
	automake
	autoreconf
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install
