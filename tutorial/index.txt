How do I Myrddin
----------------

The question on your mind when you go to sleep. The thought eating at your
psyche when you take a dump. The burning question, the enigma that eats
at your brain: *"How Do I Myrddin?"*.

I will attempt to answer this question, if you follow along with me.

Setup
-----

In order to develop, you need an environment. 

[Installing Myrddin](setup)

Downloading, installing, and making sure that everything
works. Covers checking out the language from git and
installing.

Also mentions setting up some optional utilities, like syntax
highlighting and autoindentation.
